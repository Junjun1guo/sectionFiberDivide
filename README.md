# sectionFiberDivide
Generate sectional fibers based on python programming

The followings are some basic examples, you can also obtain these examples using help(circleSection) and help(polygonSection).

## Circle section fiber generate
<img src="https://github.com/Junjun1guo/sectionFiberDivide/raw/main/circle.jpg" width =40% height =40% div align="center">

```python
from sectionFiberMain import circleSection
name="circle"#section name
outD=2  # the diameter of the outside circle
coverThick=0.05  # the thinckness of the cover concrete
outbarD=0.03  # outside bar diameter
outbarDist=0.15  # outside bar space
coreSize=0.1  # the size of core concrete fiber
coverSize=0.1  # the size of cover concrete fiber
plotState=True  # plot the fiber or not plot=True or False
corFiber,coverFiber,barFiber=circleSection(name,outD, coverThick, outbarD, outbarDist, coreSize, coverSize,plotState)
```

##  CircleHole section fiber generate
<img src="https://github.com/Junjun1guo/sectionFiberDivide/raw/main/circleHole.jpg" width =40% height =40% div align="center">

```python
from sectionFiberMain import circleSection
name="circleHole" #section name
outD = 2  # the diameter of the outside circle
coverThick = 0.06  # the thinckness of the cover concrete
outbarD = 0.03  # outside bar diameter
outbarDist = 0.15  # outside bar space
coreSize = 0.1  # the size of core concrete fiber
coverSize = 0.1  # the size of cover concrete fiber
plotState = True  # plot the fiber or not plot=True or False
inD =1 # the diameter of the inside circle
inBarD=0.03 # inside bar diameter
inBarDist=0.15 # inside bar space
corFiber, coverFiber, barFiber = circleSection(name,outD, coverThick, outbarD, outbarDist, coreSize, coverSize,
                                                   plotState,inD,inBarD,inBarDist)
